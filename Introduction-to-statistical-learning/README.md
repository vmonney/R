# Introduction-to-statistical-learning

Here are the exercises I did while reading the book [Introduction to statistical learning](https://github.com/vmonney/Introduction-to-statistical-learning/blob/master/(Springer%20Texts%20in%20Statistics%2C%20Vol.%20103)%20Gareth%20James%2C%20Daniela%20Witten%2C%20Trevor%20Hastie%2C%20Robert%20Tibshirani%20-%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Statistical%20Learning%20with%20Applications%20in%20R-Springer%20(2013).pdf).

The exercises are divided by chapter available in each folder.
