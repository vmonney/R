# R-Projects-EPFL
All projects of the EPFL Extensions School course: "Applied Data Science: Communication and Visualization with R". 

In order to respect the wish of the creators of this course not to disclose the answers of the projects, I have provided only the final report. If you would like more information about the code, you can contact me privately at : monney.valentin@gmail.com

Thank you for your understanding.

Projects from course 1 and 2 are some Rmarkdown reports. Projects from course 3,4 and the capstone projects are Shinyapps (interactive Dashboards).
